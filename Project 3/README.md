# Project 3: Advanced Decision Tree Analysis and Model Comparison

## Overview
This project involves advanced decision tree analysis, Bayesian classification, computational complexity analysis, and model comparison.

## Tasks

### Decision Tree Analysis and Bayesian Classification
**Tasks:**
- Compare converting decision trees to rules before and after pruning.
- Calculate the computational complexity of growing a decision tree.
- Develop an efficient method for constructing decision trees with large datasets.
- Explain the principles behind naive Bayesian classification.
- Modify the decision tree algorithm to account for generalized data tuples and construct a decision tree from the given employee data.
- Perform naive Bayesian classification on a given data tuple.

### Computational Complexity and Model Comparison
**Tasks:**
- Prove the relationship between accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
- Compute and plot the ROC curve for a given set of data tuples.
- Compare two prediction models using cross-validation results to determine if one is significantly better than the other.
