# Project 6: Clustering Techniques and Enhancements

## Overview
This project focuses on various clustering techniques, their comparisons, and proposed enhancements to existing algorithms.

## Tasks

### Clustering Techniques and Comparisons
**Tasks:**
- Compare k-means and k-medoids clustering techniques in terms of computational efficiency and robustness to outliers.
- Contrast these techniques with hierarchical clustering methods.
- Analyze the limitations of BIRCH in identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes.
- Propose modifications to improve BIRCH's ability to handle non-spherical clusters.
